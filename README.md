## Security
The wallets are stored in the local storage of the SAFEW browser extension.<br/>
The mnemonic is encrypted (AES-256) with the spending password, that is not stored in the application.<br/>
The password will be required to spend funds or to add or discover new addresses.<br/>
You can use ErgoPay wallet to keep your secrets on a mobile device (iOS or Android wallet)<br/>
ErgoPay wallets are available to sign remotely the transaction using iOS or Android wallet v1.6+, to avoid to store the encrypted mnemonic in your browser extension local storage.<br/>

## Privacy
The address discovery can be launched at any time to generate unused addresses in the wallets.<br/>
Non connected sites have no access to the information of your wallet.<br/>
Connected sites can read the wallet content.<br/>
The explorer and node used to interact with Ergo blockchain are configurable.<br/>
ErgoPay/ReadOnly wallets allow you to keep the content of your wallet hidden..<br/>
ErgoMixer integration ease the usage of privacy tools.<br/>

## Reliability
The transaction balance displayed when sending funds using SAFEW is computed from the unsigned transaction, not from the UI inputs.<br/>

## Build the project
> git clone https://github.com/ThierryM1212/SAFEW.git<br/>
> cd SAFEW <br/>
> npm install <br/>
> npm run build-prod <br/>
<br/>
Load the unpacked extension as described at: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/ <br/>
<br/>
It requires to disable Yoroi or Nautilus extension to use the dApp connector.<br/>

## debug
> npm run watch<br/>
And reload the extension from the build directory<br/>
Set the key "debug" = "true" in the local storage to display dApp connector popups buttons<br/>

## dApp Connector
It tries to follow https://github.com/Emurgo/Emurgo-Research/blob/master/ergo/EIP-0012.md
sign_tx_input, sign_data and add_external_box are not implemented yet

Same ergo_request_read_access and ergo_check_read_access than Yoroi method are declared to ensure the compatibility of existing dApp using Yoroi.

## Next steps ?
Ledger signing (Waiting on ledger-ergo-app fix)<br/>
